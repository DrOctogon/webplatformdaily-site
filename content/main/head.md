## Current status

**August 19th update:** I’ve released the below mentioned  master issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformdaily-site/issues/48).

Hi everyone! This digest will be offline for 3 weeks. During the first week (August 12th to 18th), I’ll define my plans for upcoming features. On Sunday, August 18th, I’ll release a “master issue” on GitHub detailing those plans. I welcome feedback. Then, I’ll be on vacation for 2 weeks. The next daily will be released on September 2nd.
