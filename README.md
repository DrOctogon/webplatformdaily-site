## What's coming next for this daily?

Next I'm implementing some sort of search functionality. So, you enter a term like "WebGL" and the entire database is filtered by that term.

## Is there an RSS feed?

Nope. It'll come eventually.

## When are new dailies released?

Weekdays in the early morning hours (European time).

## Where is the data stored?

In Markdown files, which makes it open source. You're free to use the data anyhow you like.

## What goes into creating a daily?

I gather the content from Twitter, i.e. from the tweets of the ~130 people I follow on Twitter. Usually, I select around 40-50 tweets (potential entries). Then, based on those tweets I create around 20-30 entries for the daily.

## What topics are covered?

 - Open Web Platform (including the open standards that comprise it)
 - JavaScript (the core language and libraries written in it)
 - web-browsers (including their development tools)
 - front-end web-development in general
 - open source to some degree (e.g. GitHub related content)
 - openness (open data)
 - privacy

## How do you decide what goes into a daily?

The general rule is that the content should be recent (say, less than 2 weeks old) and relevant for the majority of visitors.

## May I suggest content?

Sure. Just mention [@simevidas](http://twitter.com/simevidas) on Twitter.
