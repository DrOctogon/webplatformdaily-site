Yes. It’s [available here](http://feeds.feedburner.com/OpenWebPlatformDailyDigest).

### What goes into creating a daily?

I gather the content from Twitter, i.e. from the tweets of the ~160 people I follow on Twitter. Usually, I select around 40-50 tweets (candidates). Then, based on those tweets I create around 20-30 entries for the daily.
 
### What topics are covered?

 - Open Web Platform (including the open standards that comprise it)
 - JavaScript (the core language and libraries written in it)
 - web-browsers (including their development tools)
 - front-end web-development in general
 - Node.js, Grunt
 - open source to some degree (e.g. GitHub related content)
 - openness (open data)
 - privacy

### What are the criteria for the content?

The general rule is that the content should be recent (say, less than 2 weeks old), relevant for the majority of visitors, direct and easily digestible.

### May I suggest content?

Sure. Just mention [@simevidas](http://twitter.com/simevidas) on Twitter.
